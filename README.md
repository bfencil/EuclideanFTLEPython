The Python code for computing Coherent Structures based on Finite-Time-Lyapunov Exponents (FTLE) and Lagrangian deformation for flow on curved surfaces is available at this [link](https://github.com/SreejithSanthosh/CurvedSurfacesFTLEPython). The following tutorial provides instructions on how to use the code. To understand the mathematical background or additional information on the methods discussed here, we refer you to the accompanying manuscript [S. Santhosh, C. Zhu, B. Fencil, M. Serra](Necessary Link).
